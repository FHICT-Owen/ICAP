## Sprint 1
I'm quite unsatisfied with my own progression for this first sprint. I'll be picking up the speed and start producing more professional products and functional code starting monday the 9th of October. 

## Sprint 2
There was a lot of last-minute work on my end for this sprint, but I managed to create a substantial amount of code, documents and other professional products for my sprint delivery. I managed to get inter-service communication, the CI/CD pipeline, Static Code analysis using Sonarcloud, 2 or more microservices and the rewrite of the user stories done. I plan on picking up the remaining user stories for the next sprint ASAP and also start verifying functionality using tests as soon as possible.
