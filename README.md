## Sprint 1
I'm quite unsatisfied with my own progression for this first sprint. I'll be picking up the speed and start producing more professional products and functional code starting monday the 9th of October. 

## Sprint 2
There was a lot of last-minute work on my end for this sprint, but I managed to create a substantial amount of code, documents and other professional products for my sprint delivery. I managed to get inter-service communication, the CI/CD pipeline, Static Code analysis using Sonarcloud, 2 or more microservices and the rewrite of the user stories done. I plan on picking up the remaining user stories for the next sprint ASAP and also start verifying functionality using tests as soon as possible.

## Sprint 3
Sprint 3 went a lot better. The teachers were happy with the progress I made in regards to deployment and other evidence that I was able to show as well. In order to improve even more it is important that my presentations are a little bit better organized with a list of evidence that I want to show for the sprint so the presentation does not come over as messy or unstructured. Additionally, I'll also make sure to deliver my portfolio in-time so I can show the teachers the required evidence in order to grade me and give me an accurate estimate on my progress.

## Sprint 4
Sprint 4 deliverables were pretty mediocre. This comes down to having to do work on a lot of documentation and unforeseen circumstances. Last weekend of delivery I also had to move which took almost an entire week of my time.

## Sprint 5 (final)
The progress in sprint 5 was very remarkable and good for achieving the learning outcomes that were set out at the start of the semester. I have learned a lot during this semester when it comes to technical learning outcomes.
