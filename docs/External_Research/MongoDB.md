# MongoDB scaling performance
MongoDB is the main database choice for ICAP. Within the context of creating an enterprise application that should be able to scale to hundreds of thousands of users or even millions it is also important to have a database that is able to grow with you. 

MongoDB has various offers and technologies in place that allow you to seamlessly scale the NoSQL database in both a horizontal and vertical way as can be seen [here](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/scaling). 

When it comes to out of the box, apples to apples performance comparisons, MongoDB requested that a white paper be made, comparing various NoSQL database solutions. Those solutions can be found below.

[Popular NoSQL database performance compared](./High+Performance+Benchmark+White+Paper_final.pdf). From this whitepaper can be concluded that performing within the same environment, MongoDB comes out on top.
