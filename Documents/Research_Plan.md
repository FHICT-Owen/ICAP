# Research plan

## Introduction
ICAP is designed to be an all-encompassing enterprise scale web platform. It would replace a lot of existing separated out communities and platforms for talking about airsoft and bring it all into a single platform that allows for direct-messaging, commisioning, buying & selling, live-updating forums and group matching. An interesting aspect to look at is the combination of scalable/enterprise architecture with messaging and live-updating. Enterprise architecture mostly uses async messaging to function so how would live-updating forums and messaging function within the architecture?

## Research question
The research for the project aims to provide more insight into the abovementioned combination of enterprise architecture and live messaging: 
```
What architectural and technological considerations when designing ICAP's live-updating forum and real-time messaging system to accommodate 100,000 concurrent users, while ensuring sub-second message delivery and forum updates?
```

Some of the most interesting sub-questions that can be formulated based off this research question are:
1. How does the choice between long-polling and event-driven architecture impact the real-time responsiveness of the application?
2. 
3. 
4. 
5.

## Methods
Using the methods provided by ICTResearchMethods we can assign some examplary strategies to the sub-questions in order to get results back for the research questions that is easy to fact-check.
